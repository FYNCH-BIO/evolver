min-eVOLVER Server Code
===================

This code sits on the computer and handles communications between the DPU and the SAMD21 microcontroller that monitors and actuates experimental parameters. Calibrations, experiment commands, and data transmission are all handled by this code using `python socket-io <https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `pyserial <https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/>`_.

Installation & Running the Server
